# Biogenesis

**Biotechnology stands at the threshold of a transformative revolution in clinical trials**. A revolution where we're not just reimagining, but radically reshaping the landscape of clinical trials. We're at a pivotal juncture, engineering a groundbreaking synergy between scientists and physicians, turbocharging drug development, and igniting a radical shift in healthcare paradigms.

This isn't a mere shift; it's a colossal transformation. We're not just fine-tuning the gears of an existing system; we're constructing a powerful, game-changing machine from scratch. It's an epoch where we're not bystanders, but proactive pioneers of a future that holds the potential to revolutionize healthcare as we know it.

## The Challenge in Clinical Trials Today

The skyrocketing cost of drug development, exceeding **$2 billion** and **10 years**, alongside a **90% failure rate**, stands as a formidable giant in the path of discovering and developing new treatments. Clinical trials today are made up of a plethora of **phase transition periods**, where researchers wait for months to years between trials to find sites, file and complete the necessary documentation and paperwork and traverse the vast regulatory framework.
